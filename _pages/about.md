ABOUT ME



DOMINIK DELLERMANN

I am a co-founder of the startups Darwin, vencortex and Darwin CEE. I recently submitted my Ph.D. thesis at Kassel University/Germany with the topic “Accelerating Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Through Hybrid Intelligence-Design Paradigms and Principles for Decisional Guidance in Entrepreneurship” and I am still an active associate researcher at the University of St. Gallen/Switzerland working with Philipp Ebel.

In addition to my ongoing research, I regularly hold seminars on hybrid intelligence and business model design, work with executives, and cooperate with journalists on those topics.

I am particularly interested in how human and artificial intelligence can be combined for decision-making in a complex, dynamic and uncertain world. Moreover, I am curious about token economies and how new skin-in-the-game incentives can be applied in such hybrid intelligence systems.
